                    Labrador retrievers are sturdy, solid dogs. They are almost square in appearance, with a strong body and sturdy legs. Field line bred dogs are often taller and somewhat thinner in build.

                    Labrador retrievers are excellent family dogs, as long as you keep in mind their need for exercise and training. These are dogs bred to work and work hard and they love to have jobs to do, particularly retrieving.

Labs are usually good with other dogs, other pets, and children as long as training has toned down their natural exuberance. They are strong dogs and need some obedience training at an early age or they can be seen dragging their owners down the street at will.

Owing to their energetic nature, Labradors who are left alone or not well exercised can become destructive â€” chewing, digging and barking to excess.
