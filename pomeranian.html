                    The Pomeranian is a true "toy" dog, with an ideal height of eight to 11 inches and weight of only three to seven pounds.
                    They are often at mature size by seven to 10 months of age.

                    Pomeranians are generally perky, friendly little dogs.
These are active little dogs that do need daily exercise, even if it is just a walk around the block. They are quite intelligent and do well in obedience competitions despite a small independent streak. As they age, they are more amenable to being truly lap dogs.
Pomeranians are often good alert and alarm dogs and can be prone to excessive barking.
